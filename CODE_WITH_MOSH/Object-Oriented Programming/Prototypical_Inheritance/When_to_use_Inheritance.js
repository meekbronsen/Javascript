// Keep it simple
// Start with simple objects and then if you see these object sharing properties then you can encapsulate those properties and inheritance.
// Avoid creating Inheritance Hierachies like: Animals --> Mammals and Amphibians.
// Do not go more than one level of inheritance, so no more than Animal level
